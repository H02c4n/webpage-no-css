          Several of the major characters in the novel belong to the same
          workshop of miniaturists in the Ottoman Empire during the reign of
          Murat III. The first chapter of the novel ("I am a corpse") is
          narrated by one of the workshop's illuminators (Elegant Effendi) who
          has just been murdered. In the chapters narrated by his murderer, the
          reader learns that this illuminator was concerned about the
          increasingly Western attitude towards painting in a project
          commissioned by the Sultan. Subsequent chapters are narrated by
          different characters - - including four living members of the Sultan's
          workshop, a man named Black who has just returned to his uncle's home
          in Istanbul after 12 years of travel and who is the first living
          character to narrate the novel - -, by several drawings (the archetype
          of a horse, a dog, a counterfeit gold coin, Satan, and two dervishes);
          and one chapter, which gives the novel its name, is narrated by the
          color red. In all, there are 21 different narrators.[3]: 125
