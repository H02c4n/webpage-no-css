          Yunus Emre was born in 1238 in Anatolia. He was a Sufi and one of the
          first to compose poetry in the everyday Turkish of his people. Not
          much is known about the details of his life, but his work reveals a
          fascinating character: a tortured soul, a biting wit, a
          self-depreciating humor, a tough love for humanity, an ecstatic love
          for God, and a deep current of divine inspiration. Over 700 years
          later, he remains one of the most beloved poets in the Turkish
          language, seen by many as a folk hero and a saint. His popularity has
          recently spiked due to a series on YouTube about his life. Just like
          us, Yunus lived in a time of upheaval and rapid change, and his poems
          have a vital message, showing us that reaching out for the divine can
          be both an escape from the worlds' struggles and an all-consuming
          struggle of its own. His intense and uncompromising humanism speaks to
          people in all times, all places, and all walks of life. This
          translation tries to capture some of the rhyme and rhythm of the
          original language, and to express its truth in everyday speech, the
          way it was meant to be enjoyed.
