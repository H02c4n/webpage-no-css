          In Vienna, Austria-Hungary, 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is
          arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a
          magic show involving necromancy. Later, Uhl explains the story of
          Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold. Eisenheim was born Eduard
          Abramovich, the son of a cabinet-maker, and became interested in
          magic. He fell in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, but the
          two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a
          peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught and separated by
          force. Eisenheim studied magic by travelling the world, and fifteen
          years later, returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he
          encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry
          the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women
          and even murdered one. Leopold invites Eisenheim to conduct a private
          performance at the palace. During the performance, Eisenheim
          humiliates the Crown Prince in front of the royal guests; in response,
          he is banned from performing again in Vienna. When Sophie comes to
          offer him help, they make love. Eisenheim asks her to flee with him,
          but she is afraid that they will be executed. She reveals that the
          Crown Prince is planning a coup d'Ã©tat against his elderly father, the
          Emperor Franz Joseph I.
