          In September 1939, Władysław Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, is
          playing live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during
          the Nazi German invasion of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory,
          Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when he learns that Britain
          and France have declared war on Germany, but the promised aid does not
          come. The fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German
          and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different
          fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government.
          Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses and are also
          made to wear blue Star of David armbands. By November 1940, Szpilman
          and his family are forced from their home into the isolated and
          overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto, where conditions only get worse. People
          starve, the SS guards are brutal, starving children are abandoned, and
          dead bodies are everywhere. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the
          SS kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a
          round-up, including dumping an elderly man in a wheelchair out of a
          window three stories up.
