          In Pittsburgh, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the
          Allegheny River from PNC Park, dropping a quarter into the meter.
          Using a rifle, he shoots and kills five people on the river's North
          Shore Trail from long range before driving off. The Pittsburgh Police,
          headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing and the
          quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to
          James Barr, an ex-United States Army sniper. When the police raid his
          house, they find the van, the rifle, and Barr unconscious. During an
          interrogation by Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin, Barr is
          offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full
          confession or a guaranteed death sentence, as Rodin has never lost a
          case. Barr instead writes "Get Jack Reacher" on a notepad. Jack
          Reacher is a drifter and ex-US Army Military Police Corps investigator
          and major. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news broadcast
          about Barr. Emerson and Rodin deny Jack's request to view the
          evidence, but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow
          inmates and is now in a coma. Jack meets Barr's defense attorney,
          Helen Rodin, Alex Rodin's daughter. Helen tells Jack he can see the
          evidence if he will be her investigator, but Jack retorts that he is
          not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a
          killing spree during his tour of duty in Iraq, but was not prosecuted
          because, unbeknownst to Barr, his military contractor victims had just
          emerged from a weekend of assaulting numerous women, and the US Army
          just wanted the whole mess forgotten.
