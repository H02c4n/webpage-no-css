            <p>
              The Illusionist is a 2006 American romantic mystery film written
              and directed by Neil Burger, and starring Edward Norton, Paul
              Giamatti, and Jessica Biel. It is based loosely on Steven
              Millhauser's short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist". The film
              tells the story of Eisenheim, a magician in turn-of-the-century
              Vienna, who reunites with his childhood love, a woman far above
              his social standing. The film also depicts a fictionalized version
              of the Mayerling incident.
