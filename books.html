              Power is good for one thing only: to increase our happiness and
              the happiness of others. Being peaceful and happy is the most
              important thing in our lives and yet most of the time we suffer,
              we run after our cravings, we look to the past or the future for
              our happiness. <a href="./art-of-power.html">...Read more</a>

            <p>
              My Name Is Red (Turkish: Benim Adim Kirmizi) is a 1998 Turkish
              novel by writer Orhan Pamuk translated into English by Erdağ
              Göknar in 2001. The novel, concerning miniaturists in the Ottoman
              Empire of 1591, established Pamuk's international reputation and
              contributed to his reception of the Nobel Prize in Literature in
              2006. <a href="./my-name-is-red.html">...Read more</a>

            <span><em>Author: </em>Yunus Emre</span>
            <p>
              Over 700 years later, he remains one of the most beloved poets in
              the Turkish language, seen by many as a folk hero and a saint. His
              popularity has recently spiked due to a series on YouTube about
              his life. Just like us, Yunus lived in a time of upheaval and
              rapid change, and his poems have a vital message, showing us that
              reaching out for the divine can be both an escape from the worlds’
              struggles and an all-consuming struggle of its own. His intense
              and uncompromising humanism speaks to people in all times, all
              places, and all walks of life.
